# Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption

## Project Description
This project provides a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. The program allows users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Aftab571-a/your-repository-name.git
   ```
  

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   No external libraries are required for this project. Make sure you have Python installed.

3. **Run the Program:**
   Open the terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python caesar_cipher.py
   ```
   Follow the on-screen instructions to enter the message and shift value.

## Usage
- **Encryption:** Enter the message and a positive shift value to encrypt the text.
- **Decryption:** Enter the encrypted message and a negative shift value (or the original shift value in negative) to decrypt the text.
